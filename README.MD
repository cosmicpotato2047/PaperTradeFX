## ðŸ›  Running in Eclipse

If you're running this project in **Eclipse**, please follow these steps:

1. **Configure JavaFX SDK**
    - Go to: `Project` > `Properties` > `Java Build Path` > `Libraries`
    - Click `Add External JARs...` and add all the JAR files from `lib/javafx-sdk-21.0.7/lib`
    - Add the following **VM arguments**:
        
        ```
        cpp
        CopyEdit
        --module-path "lib/javafx-sdk-21.0.7/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
        
        ```
        
2. **Set the Correct Source Folder**
    - Make sure the `src/` folder is marked as a **Source Folder**.
    - The `trade.fxml` file should be located either in the project root or directly under `src/` to be loaded properly.
3. **JDK Version**
